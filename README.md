## Welcome to the Blvcker Hackathon

### Background and Context

#### What is Blvcker?
An app created with a deeper knowledge and appreciation of spades culture. We have taken our time to insure that we have created a gameplay experience that is as close to real life as possible.

#### Why this hackathon needed to exist?
We’re calling all software developers, UI/UX designers, project managers, and anyone interested in tech to compete in developing a live streaming feature for the Blvcker spades app. Also, this event offers a specific space to innovate, network, and shine within the tech community!

* **UI/UX Design**
    - Functional and/or aesthetic enhancement
    - Improving usability through a more engaging, intutive interface.
